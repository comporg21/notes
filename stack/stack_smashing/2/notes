from test.s we see
that

buffer1 is located at -13(%rbp)

we also know that return address is located at 8(%rbp)

ret addr     8(%rbp)
              (%rbp)
border1    -13(%rbp)

so 13 + 8 is address of return address.


now lets disassemble main
gdb test
disassemble main

we see that offset from the next instruction after return
and next instruction is 7
