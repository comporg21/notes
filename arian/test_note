languages have defined operators, like +, -, /, etc. In this example we have two operators, parentheses and a comma. Parentheses are used to prioritize expression calculations, comma defines a sequence of the expressions. in this example, first will execute the first expression in parentheses, which is 1, and will return 1, then will execute 2, which will return 2, and parentheses will return the last result of those expressions, means - 2.
